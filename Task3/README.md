# Task 3: ATM Interface

## Description:
The ATM Interface is a Java program that simulates an ATM machine. It includes options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.

## Implementation Steps:
1. **Create a class to represent the ATM machine.**
2. **Design the user interface for the ATM:** Include options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
3. **Implement methods for each option:** Implement methods like withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
4. **Create a class to represent the user's bank account:** This class stores the account balance.
5. **Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class:** This allows access to and modification of the account balance.
6. **Validate user input:** Ensure it is within acceptable limits, such as sufficient balance for withdrawals.
7. **Display appropriate messages:** Provide feedback to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.

## How to Use:
1. Compile the `ATM.java` file.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform transactions.
4. The program validates user input and displays appropriate messages based on the chosen options.
