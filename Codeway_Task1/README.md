# Task 1: Number Game

## Description:
The Number Game is a Java program where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The user receives feedback on whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low.

## Implementation Steps:
1. **Generate a random number:** Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. **Prompt the user to guess:** Ask the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. **Compare the guess:** Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether it's correct, too high, or too low.
4. **Repeat until correct:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.

## Additional Features:
5. **Limit attempts:** Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
6. **Multiple rounds:** Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
7. **Display score:** Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

## How to Play:
1. Compile the `NumberGame.java` file.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number within the specified range.
4. The game will provide feedback on each guess and inform you if the guess is correct.
5. Play multiple rounds if desired, and the game will keep track of your score.
